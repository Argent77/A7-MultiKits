## Overview

With this mod it is possible to install true multiclass kits from any combination of single-class kits, which allows unusual combinations such as *Kensai/Assassin* or *Berserker/Wild Mage/Swashbuckler*. Custom kits from mods are considered as well if detected.

The mod supports any Enhanced Edition games since patch version 2.0 or later, except PsT:EE.

## Components

The mod contains 10 individual components, one for each available multiclass combination:
1. Fighter / Mage
1. Fighter / Cleric
1. Fighter / Thief
1. Fighter / Mage / Thief
1. Mage / Thief
1. Cleric / Mage
1. Cleric / Thief
1. Fighter / Druid
1. Fighter / Mage / Cleric
1. Cleric / Ranger

Each component offers two options how to install kits:

### All kit combinations

This option installs all compatible multiclass kit combinations based on existing single-class kits. Some combinations may be skipped because of mutually exclusive race or alignment restrictions. For instance, the multiclass kit "Dwarven Defender / Wild Mage" may be unavailable as the Wild Mage kit is not available to dwarves.

**CAUTION:** The number of potential kit combinations, as well as potential installation time, grows exponentially with the number of available single-class kits.

### Choose manually

This option provides an interactive menu that allows to install one or more multiclass kit combinations. Selected kits can be named individually by the user.
